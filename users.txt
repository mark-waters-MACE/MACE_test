// This is a simple text file to make changes to
// When making changes we typically perform them on a branch away from the master copy of the program
// That way, we keep the master branch as the one we use for production and we know it works
// we can make changes to our copy in another branch and it doesn't matter if we make the code fail

// This is the Master Branch
